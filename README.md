# BallAndBeamController
This project considers a robot on which there is a beam with a ball. The robot is given various reference positions in sequence, which it is to move to without the ball falling off the beam. For this purpose, the angle of the beam and the position of the robot can be actively controlled by a motor. A controller was designed that reacts correctly to reference position changes without violating the constraints, despite disturbances.
